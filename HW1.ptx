<section><title>Directions and Introduction</title>
<p>Submit a pdf of your solutions to the HW 1 assignment on Gradescope by 11:59 pm on </p>
<p>Problem 2 is marked as a peer review problem. <url href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jSw9pmMJJFUx_6dTkcUi4k4HJNIrrIIgs9zdWhAycx0/edit?usp=sharing">This document gives directions and deadlines for the peer review process.</url></p>

<p>When working on this assignment, you should focus on the following goals:</p>
<ul>
<li> Demonstrate fluency with the skill of proving that two graphs are or are not isomorphic. </li>
<li>Clearly communicate solutions using complete sentences and enough explanation that another 5707 student could follow your work.</li>
<li> Demonstrate fluency with the concept of degree sequences. </li>
<li> Translate a scenario or problem into a question or statement about graphs. </li>
<li> Demonstrate fluency with basic graph theory terminology and notation, such as <m>\nu(G)</m>, <m>\epsilon(G)</m>, <m>\bar{G}</m>, bipartite, complete, simple graph, multigraph, cycles, etc. </li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li> <p>Draw a simple graph <m>G</m> that satisfies the following properties, or explain why no such graph can exist. </p>
  <ul>
    <li> <m>G</m> is bipartite.</li>
    <li> <m>\varepsilon(\bar{G})=12</m>.</li>
    <li> <m>G</m> contains a cycle of length <m>6</m>.</li>
    <li> <m>\nu(G)</m> is odd.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><p> (Peer Review Problem; 1.5.7(a) from Bondy-Murty)</p>
    
  <ol><li> Let <m>{\bf d}=(d_1,d_2,\ldots, d_n)</m> be a non-increasing sequence of non-negative integers, and denote the sequence <m>(d_2-1, d_3-1,\ldots,d_{d_1+1}-1,d_{d_1+2},\ldots, d_n)</m> by <m>{\bf d}'</m>. Show that, <m>{\bf d} </m> is graphic if and only if <m>{\bf d}'</m> is graphic.</li>
  <li>Explain any changes you made as a result of the peer review process. Your explanation should clearly state what was wrong with your rough draft and what changes you made. <url href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jSw9pmMJJFUx_6dTkcUi4k4HJNIrrIIgs9zdWhAycx0/edit?usp=sharing">See the grading criteria for Peer Review for reflection examples and templates.</url> </li>
  </ol> </li> 
  <li> <p>For each of the following sets of properties, either give an example graph that satisfies those properties or explain why no graph can exist.</p>
<ol>
  <li>A multigraph with degree sequence <m>(7, 6, 5,4, 3, 3, 2)</m>.</li>
  <li>A simple graph with degree sequence <m>(7, 6, 5,4, 3, 3, 2)</m>.</li>
</ol>

  </li>
  <li><p>Determine which pairs of the following graphs are isomorphic. Justify your answers. </p>
